# Arduino-application-in-post-accident-detection-and-rescue-system
In Vietnam, the number of traffic vehicles and traffic accidents is increasing.
Currently, in the mid-tier model and below, there is no warning and rescue system that
is equipped to deal with vehicle crashes, especially when it occurs at night. It is
difficult for people in distress and can even lead to death in some emergencies. In this
paper, we propose to build a model of automobile accident detection and messaging
system using Automatic using Accelerometer sensor, GPS module, and GSM module.
The experimental test results show that the system works well, the response time is
moderately fast and the price is cheap.
